## Description

The Pixa-BY API Image Fetcher and Offline Storage is a mobile application that allows users to fetch images from the Pixa-BY API and display them in a user-friendly card format. In addition to online image fetching, the application provides offline functionality by storing the fetched data in a local Room database. This ensures that users can still view and manage their favorite images even when their data connection is unavailable.

## Features

- **Image Fetching**: Fetch data from the Pixa-BY API, including images and associated metadata.

- **Card-Based UI**: Display the fetched images in a visually appealing card format, making it easy for users to browse and interact with the images.

- **Offline Data Storage**: Store the fetched data in a Room database, allowing users to access previously fetched images without an internet connection.

- **Smart Sync**: Automatically synchronize with the Pixa-BY API when an internet connection is detected, ensuring that users have access to the latest images.

- **Search Functionality**: Implement search and filtering options to help users find specific images based on keywords, categories, or tags.

- **Image Details**: Allow users to view detailed information about a selected image, including the author, tags, and more.

- **Favorites**: Enable users to mark images as favorites and create a personalized collection of preferred images.

- **Customization**: Offer options for users to customize the app's appearance, such as changing the layout or theme to suit their preferences.

- **Optimized Performance**: Design the app for efficient data retrieval and smooth performance, even when dealing with a large image collection.

- **Cross-Platform**: Ensure that the app is available on multiple platforms, making it convenient for users to access their images on various devices.
